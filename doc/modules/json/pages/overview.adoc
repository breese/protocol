== Incremental Overview

Trial.Protocol provides several ways of parsing and generating JSON as shown in
the table below.

.Approaches to parsing and generating JSON 
|===
|Parser |Generator
|*Incremental* |The JSON input can be parsed token by token with an [incremental parser]. For each token we can obtain its current type and value. The JSON output can be generated token by token with an https://leminhos.gitlab.io/doc.trial.protocol/trial.protocol/protocol/json/guide.html#protocol[incremental generator].
|*Serialization* |The JSON input can be deserialized directly into our C++ data structures with an https://leminhos.gitlab.io/doc.trial.protocol/trial.protocol/protocol/json/iarchive.html[input archive]. Notice that the input archive does not go through an intermediate http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model[Document Object Model], so we can get better performance. Our C++ data structures can be serialized directly into a JSON output with an https://leminhos.gitlab.io/doc.trial.protocol/trial.protocol/protocol/json/oarchive.html[output archive].

The incremental parser and generator are the basic building-blocks.
Serialization combines these building-blocks with Boost.Serialization to offer
an API that is easier to use.

The incremental parser can also be used to create other kinds of parser interfaces,
such as a push parser as we shall see in the tutorial.
